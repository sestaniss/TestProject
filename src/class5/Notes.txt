Helps use take the input from keyboard
Logical Operators:
  Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values. There are
  Logical operators ! || &&

  Why should we learn about the logical operators?
  we can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

  What is syntax:
  They only work with boolean data type
  if(! condition)
  if (condition1 || condition 2)



  Not Operator(!)
  Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is it will make it false if somethign
  is false it will mae it true.

  What is a SwitchCase statement:

  Switch case statement are just another way of achieving the same results as if-else-if conditions

  why should we learn about them:
  The reason we should use them is they are very fast.
  Syntax:

  Starting var:
  switch(var){
  case 1:
  sout"1"

  Rules that we should follow
  1)we can only use byte short int char String in switch case statement.
  2)we can`t use relational operators in switch case statements are also not allowed
  3) we can`t use logical operators
