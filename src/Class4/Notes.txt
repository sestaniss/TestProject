Operators:
 Operators are different symbol that we can use to perform operations like Addition, subtractions we can
 compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than thhe other number or not.
 There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operator and Logical operators.
 Arithmetic operators:
  We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like Addition, subtraction etc.
  +  Addition
  -  Subtraction
  / Division
  * Multiplication
  % Modulus, Remainder

  Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something
    is bigger than other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
    == used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
    != used to check if two variables don`t contain the same value. we get a True if they are not same.
    > used to check if something is greater than other value or not if greater we get True.
    < usedto check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a True.
    >= if the value on left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are same we will get True.
    <= it is opposite of >= and it is used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.
   Conditional constructs
    used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on a condition if condition is true that java
    execute the code otherwise it skips that code.
    How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code

    if (){

    }

    }
    Important Notes:
    1)For String we use equals method instead of === sign because it is a non-primitive data type
    2)we can CTRL+alt+L to format our code
    3)if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.


    If else conditions
    If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else if
    If I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
