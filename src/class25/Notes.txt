Abstraction:
    Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
    In java, we can achieve this in two ways 1) Abstract classes, 2) interfaces
Interface:
    It is very similar to a abstract class. We can have private methods static methods default method abstract method we
    can be Static in an interface.  we can`t have instance fields in an interface and because we don`t
    have instance fields we also can`t have a constructor in an interface.

   // Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related,
   // whereas interfaces are best suited for providing a common functionality to unrelated classes.

Why we should learn about interface:
    When objects are closely related to each other and "is a" relationship between classes then
     we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction.
