Constructor: block of code similar to method that is executed when we create an object.

Why do we need it?- Constructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1) Constructor name be same as class
2) No return type

Type of the constructors:
1) non arguments
2) parametrized

this key word - is used to refer to the current object
this can be used with variables and methods
this. used to refer to the instance variables
In situation when local variable have same name as instance-> we use this.
 to differentiate and refer to the instance variable

this can be used to refer to the instance methods as well

this() -> can be used to call CURRENT clas constructor
