FileHandling:

 Reading and writing data to files is called fileHandling.

    1) To read or write the data first we need to know the path or location
    where we will be reading or writing that file.

    2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so
    that javaprogram can process the data from that file.
    We use two classes to navigate: one is called FileInputStream and the other one
    is called FileOutputStream. When we have to read the data we use FileInputStream
    and when we have to write the data we use the FileOutputStream.

    3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data
    from that specific file for examples we use Properties class when we have to
    the data from the .properties file.
    We use XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the Excel file.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?
    1) we will be storing data like username password URLs type of browsers etc in configuration files.
    2) when we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading all the data from files like
    xlsx or csv files.
How to Read/Write data from files:
    1) Get the path
    2)use FileInputStream/FileOutPutStream to navigate.
    3) use a specialized class like Properties or XSSFWorkBook

 What are Exceptions?
    Exceptions are runtime issues that can stop normal flow of our programs nd can abruptly terminate
    the program which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.
 Exception Handling:
    We stop the program from terminating abruptly, and we try to mitigate the issue we provide a backup code.
    and convert the error messages to simple text.
