Arrays In Java:
  Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use Indexes to get back the values.
  Why we should learn Arrays:
  If we have to store a lot of values. It becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
  Syntax of Arrays:
  We can create Arrays in two different ways.
  First Way:
  DataType [] arr={element 1, element 2, element 3};
  System.out.println(arr[0])
  Second way of creating Arrays:
  DataType[] arr=new DataType[Size]
