Exceptions:
    Exception is an unwanted behavior which occurs at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.
Exception Handling:
    Exception Handling is a mechanism that allows us runtime errors and helps us convert complex error
    message to something simpler that a normal user can understand.
How do we implement exception handling in Java:
    We have new keywords which allos us to handle exceptions in Java.
   Blocks of code 1)try 2)catch 3)finally
   Keywords 4)throw 5)throws
try block:
    in the try block we write the code which can throw an exception
catch block:
    Contains the backup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. It can also contain
    code to simplify error messages it can also contain the code which might snd a notification or an email
    to the developers or admins in cas of failure.
How it works:
    We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block. Each handling a different error
    we can also put a last catch block with Exception class so that if something goes wrong
    and there is no specific catch block to handle it The Exception one will handle it.

Finally block:
    Finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block.
    we should put cleanup code inside the finally blocks like closing a browser closing Database, connection etc.
