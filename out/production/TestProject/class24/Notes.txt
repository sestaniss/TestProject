Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism allow us to perform same action in different ways. There are two types of Polymorphism
    early binding compile and time runtime or late binding. Polymorphism that is achieved with the help of
    method overloading is called early binding or compile time polymorphism. When we achieve polymorphism with help of
    method overriding it is called run time Polymorphism.
Why we should learn Polymorphism?
    Polymorphism allows su to write less code and call multiple methods.
Polymorphism Syntax:
    1) for static Polymorphism we only need to overload a method.
    2) for the dynamic Polymorphism we need to extend from a class we need to override the methods from the parent
    class that we want to use in Polymorphism.
Final Keyword:
    There are three main uses of the final keyword.
    1) when we use the final keyword with a variable we can`t change its value once it is assigned.
    2) when we have to created constants then we declare the variables as final.
    3) when we use it with a class no other class can inherit from that class.

Abstraction:
    Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to user.
Why we should use Abstraction:
    1) It reduces the code complexity.
    2) It allows the end user to focus on using the features instead of worrying about the implementation.
Syntax:
    We need to declare the methods as Abstract if we are planning to provide the implementations.
    We also need to write the Abstract keyword with the class as well.
