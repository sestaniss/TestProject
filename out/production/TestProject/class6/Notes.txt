Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allows us to combine multiple conditions. They only work with
    boolean(true,false) values. There are three logical operators 1), !, ||,&&
 Why should we use logical operators:
  1) The can greatly simplify the logic.
  2)It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
 NOT(!):
   It reverses the conditions. if something is true it will make it false
   and if something is false it will make it true.
   System.out.println(!true) => false
  Logical Or Operator (||):
      it can combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one
      condition is true. if all conditions becomes false it returns us a false.
   Logical AND(&&):
       it can also combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all the
       conditions are true.
