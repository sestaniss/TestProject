Methods in Java:
  Is just a collection of java statements and blocks of codes like if else loop println etc...
Why should we learn about methods:
 1) It allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them
  build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
 2) Methods allows us to re-use code.
 3) Methods allow us to be flexible.
How can we create Methods?
     There are two types built-in and user defined.
Built-in methods?
    The methods which are designed by java developers for example the println() nextInt method in the scanner class
 length() present in String class they are all built-in methods.
User Defined Methods:
     They are the methods that we write.
Methods which return something when called and other are methods which do not return anything when called.

 int add(int a,int b){
 return a+b;
 }
 int => return type of a method
 add => name of the method
 (int a,int b)=> parameters of the method or the input to the method
 {=> body of the method
 }
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.
==============================================================================
There are three types of variable with respect to their scope
Local Variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition, etc...
they are called variables.
Upside:
    Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write code
 with the help of local variables.
 Downside:
    They can`t be accessed outside the block in which they are created. They have very limited scope.
Instance variables:
  All the variables which created inside a class nut outside of methods are called instance variables
  Upside:
     We can use them in all the instance methods of that clas. their scope is larger than local variables.
Downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.
static variables:
 All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables.
